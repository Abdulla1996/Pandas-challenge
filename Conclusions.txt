# Three Observerable Trends

# 1- There is a quite alot of difference in male to female ratio i.e. 78:22. Also, among all the players, most of the people who play randing in early 20's. This is significant enough to create a marketing strategy to reach out to men between the ages of 20-26.
# 2- Although 'Betrayal, Whisper of Greiving Widows' was the most purchased, in a business aspect, I would be most pleased by the 'Retribution Axe' which was most purchased. An item like this will contribute to the funding and further development of the game.
# 3- From 573 unique players who made item purchases in the game, 'Betrayal, Whisper of Greiving Widows' was the most popular item in the game. This must mean that its stats or purpose has high value in it.
